# Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management Using Event-Driven Architecture

## Event Driven Architecture

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm in software architecture where the flow of the program is determined by events. An "event" is a significant change in state or occurrence, often generated by user actions, system triggers, 
or other applications. In an EDA system, components produce events and react to them asynchronously, leading to a loosely coupled, flexible system design.

In this example, Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management will use Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to dynamically respond to real-world events like:

+ Traffic congestion or accidents on the route
+ Battery level or vehicle health
+ Customer ride requests
+ Real-time weather conditions affecting driving decisions

<b>Event Producers: Autonomous vehicles, IoT sensors, traffic systems, weather APIs.</b>

<b>Event Consumers: Fleet management system, autonomous vehicle routing service, customer ride allocation service.</b>

<b>Event Channels: Apache Kafka will act as the event backbone, handling real-time streaming of events from various producers to consumers.</b>

<b>Real-time Processing: Using Kafka Streams for processing events such as traffic rerouting, vehicle assignment, and battery optimization.</b>
